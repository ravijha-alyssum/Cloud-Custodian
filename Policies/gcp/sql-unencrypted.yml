      This policy identifies Cloud SQL instances that are not using a customer-managed
      encryption key (CMEK). GCP encrypts data by default, so this policy checks for the
      absence of a user-specified key.
    filters:
      - type: value
        key: diskEncryptionConfiguration.kmsKeyName
        value: absent
